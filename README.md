# MusicPortfolio
Music Portfolio Website made from scratch using Vite, React, react-bootstrap,react-router-dom., Using Soundcloud Embeds
Due to the soundcloud API not giving out new api keys, i'm going to hardcode the songs in the code. So my method is to put the music data from soundcloud manually into a json(Technically a js file because otherwise you need a external library to import json, and I feel it seems unnecessary in this case, functionaly similar and easy to adapt) file, then use a map function to fill in the music cards with the data of the songs I specify, depending on the category the songs go into.
