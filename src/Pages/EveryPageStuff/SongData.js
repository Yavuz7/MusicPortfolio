            "description": "Here is sample main menu music, Idr the exact name of the song it sort of follows, but I know it sounds like something I've heard in the past. The music is meant to be a main music sound track.the intention with this is song is for it to have a sense of foreboding, and a make the user feel like something grand is coming from the other side of the main menu screen. The second half of the song is meant to really give the feeling of awe to the listener. Something huge is coming, and you want to find out what it is. Lastly the song is so short because it is meant to be played on loop in a main menu, so for the best listening effect, play the song on loop.",

            "description":"This is a song that you should play when snow falls. I decided to focus on a more light song after my dreary song, jar music, and with me being a big fan of snow, I decided to aim to make a song that has a music box feel to it, akin to something you would find in a christmas special on tv. I didn't really know what to do with the ending of the song, so I decided to just have everything drift off, into the snow.",

            "description":"Made the song with a jar, using the art of timeboxing and procrastination. So I found a big jar, and then I recorded myself opening and closing the lid and hitting the jar. Then I put these sounds into ableton and pitched it really low. But it felt like the song was missing something, so I added some more sounds. Suddenly it gave off a really horror feel to the music that I enjoyed so I rolled with it. The high pitched sound and the really deep pitch changing sounds are both the same jar sample, just pitched in opposite directions, giving a really nice scary feeling, this is probably my favorite song this semster.

I didn't really know what to sample, so I asked my classmate to talk about energy drinks for a minute, and then I decided to sample that and make a song with it. I really enjoy the overlapping voices as the song progresses, showing Alex giving into the craze of energy the drink provides.            ",
